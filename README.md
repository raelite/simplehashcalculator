**Simple console application to generate hashes for string values. I made this for windows, as it doesn't provides any CLI utility to calculate hashes like Linux does.**

I recently started working on Windows, and I found out that it doesn't provodes any CLI utility to calculate hashes for string. So just made this simple python program to generate hashes for string values. You can download the EXE from here.
